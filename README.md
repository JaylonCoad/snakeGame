- In this folder contains the cpp file and exe file that can be ran by simply double clicking.

Game Details:
- The game will ask you for the number of rows and columns you want in the grid, choose any reasonable integers you want and press enter.
- Next the game will ask you for how many obstacles you want in the grid, enter a reasonable number followed by coordinates in this format: 0,0
- Note: Coordinates begin at the very top left, so 0,0 is the top left corner, and 0,1 would be one space directly to the right of that.
- The game will then ask you for the location of the gate, which is where the snake will start. Enter coordinates in the same format as above.
- Finally enter the amount of turns you want. Turns are entered as a direction (R)ight, (L)eft, (U)p, (D)own followed by a space and the integer amount of spaces in that direction. Example: R 6
- If the snake runs into itself, the game ends.
